# Find the Loophole 

This is not a CTF, more of a bug bounty.

### Rules
1. You can read but cannot modify `script.sh`
2. You can read but cannot modify `.github/workflows/autograding.yml`

> Even if you get the autograding test to succeed by editing above files, your submission is discarded automatically, and are graded 0/10.

The point of this bounty is to check if you can pass the assignment, even when the grading workflow and logic is visible.

> - Remember, there is no flag in this repo
> - You cannot directly see whether you have passed, its only available to admins on classroom dashboard.
> - Passing of autograding in your gihtub actions, DOES NOT imply passing the assignment.

Can you Pass this assignment?
